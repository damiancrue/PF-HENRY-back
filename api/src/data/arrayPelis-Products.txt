These robots worked as slaves in the outer colonies of Earth. After the bloody rebellion of a Nexus-6 team, the Replicants were banished from Earth. Special police brigades, the Blade Runners, had orders to kill all those who had not obeyed the sentence. But this was not called execution, it was called 'retirement'. After a serious incident, ex-Blade Runner Rick Deckard is called back into service to find and 'remove' rebel replicants.",
